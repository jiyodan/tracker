the .php files and the image folder need putting inside of a folder called "shows" inside of the htdocs folder in xampp/lampp. and the .sql file needs importing using the phpmyadmin web interface. you need to create a new database called "tracker" and then import the sql inside of that. the table should be called "shows".
you need to add a user inside of phpmyadmin called "tracker" with the password "password" and give it full priveleges. once those steps have been done you should be able to start the apache and mysql using the "xamp control panel" in windows or in linux by navigating to "/opt/lampp" and executing the command "./lampp start"
to access the website you navigate to "IPADDRESS/shows/index.php"
